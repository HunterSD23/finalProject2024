				<h3>The Current AI Technologies</h3>
				
				<p>"These rapid advances in AI capabilities have made it possible to use machines in a wide range of new domains: 
					When you book a flight, it is often an artificial intelligence, no longer a human, that decides what you pay. When you get to the airport, it is an AI system that monitors what you do at the airport. And once you are on the plane, an AI system assists the pilot in flying you to your destination. AI systems also increasingly determine whether you get a loan, are eligible for welfare, or get hired for a particular job. Increasingly, they help determine who is released from jail."</p>
				
				<p>"Several governments have purchased autonomous weapons systems for warfare, and some use AI systems for surveillance and oppression. AI systems help to program the software you use and translate the texts you read. Virtual assistants, operated by speech recognition, have entered many households over the last decade. Now self-driving cars are becoming a reality."</p>
				
				<p>"Artificial intelligence is no longer a technology of the future; AI is here, and much of what is reality now would have looked like sci-fi just recently. It is a technology that already impacts all of us, and the list above includes just a few of its many applications. The wide range of listed applications makes clear that this is a very general technology that can be used by people for some extremely good goals — and some extraordinarily bad ones, too. For such “dual-use technologies”, it is important that all of us develop an understanding of what is happening and how we want the technology to be used."</p>
